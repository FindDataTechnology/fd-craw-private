# permission-mode-selection Specification

## Purpose

Lets the user see and switch, per chat session, which permission preset the
dsh runtime enforces — the sandbox/approval bundle (`read-only`,
`workspace-write`, `danger-full-access`) — from the composer control strip.

## Requirements

### Requirement: The control strip shows the session's effective permission preset
The chat composer control strip SHALL render a permission control showing the
effective preset name of the current session, populated only from server
state (no optimistic local value). The control SHALL be hidden while the
roster has not been received.

#### Scenario: strip renders server state on connect
- **WHEN** a client connects and the server broadcasts the permission roster
- **THEN** the control strip shows the effective preset reported by the server

#### Scenario: unknown preset resolves to custom
- **WHEN** the effective sandbox/approval values match no preset in the table
- **THEN** the control shows the `custom` placeholder instead of a preset name

### Requirement: Selecting a preset switches the live session without a restart
The server SHALL apply a permission preset switch to the current dsh session
in place (no child restart, composer send stays enabled once the confirming
broadcast lands). The switch SHALL be rejected while a turn is streaming, and
an unknown preset name SHALL produce an error delivered only to the
requesting client.

#### Scenario: user tightens the mode mid-session
- **WHEN** the user selects `read-only` while no turn is streaming
- **THEN** the switch applies to the live session and every connected client
  receives the new current preset

#### Scenario: switch during streaming is rejected
- **WHEN** the user selects a preset while a turn is streaming
- **THEN** the server rejects the request with an error to the requesting
  client and the effective preset is unchanged

### Requirement: Every client reflects the session's permission state
The server SHALL broadcast the permission roster on client connect and the
current preset after every successful switch, so multiple open clients stay
consistent.

#### Scenario: second client observes a switch made elsewhere
- **WHEN** client A switches the preset and client B is connected
- **THEN** client B's control updates to the new preset without a reload

### Requirement: A dsh restart resets the permission to the deployment default
Because permission state is durable per dsh session, a child restart (model,
workspace, or preset switch) SHALL start the next session at the deployment
default (`DSH_PERMISSION_MODE`), and the control SHALL render that reset
value from server state once the new session reports it.

#### Scenario: restart lands back on the default
- **WHEN** the user switched to `danger-full-access` and then switches the
  model (which restarts the dsh child)
- **THEN** the next session runs under the deployment default and the control
  shows it after the restart completes

### Requirement: WebSocket permission contract
The server and client SHALL exchange permission state over the existing
WebSocket using these messages only:

| Direction | Message | Payload |
|---|---|---|
| server→client | `permissions` | `{ options: [{name,label,description}], current }` on connect and after each switch |
| server→client | `current_permission` | `{ name }` |
| client→server | `list_permissions` | — |
| client→server | `set_permission` | `{ name }` — streaming guard; unknown name → `error` to sender only |

#### Scenario: roster request returns options with display metadata
- **WHEN** a client sends `list_permissions`
- **THEN** the server replies with every switchable preset including label
  and description plus the current selection
