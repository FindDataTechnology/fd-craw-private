## Purpose

Defines the web and miniprogram surfaces where users manage scheduled tasks: browsing job state, creating tasks with schedule, agent, and prompt, and acting on jobs (pause, resume, delete, run now).

## Requirements

### Requirement: Scheduled-task management page
Both the web app and the miniprogram SHALL provide a scheduled-task management page listing all jobs with their schedule (including timezone label), prompt, target agent, status, next run, and last result. The list SHALL update live from `cron_*` events without requiring a manual refresh.

#### Scenario: Browse jobs
- **WHEN** the user opens the scheduled-task page
- **THEN** all jobs are listed with schedule, timezone, agent, prompt, status, next run, and last outcome

#### Scenario: Live update
- **WHEN** a job fires or its status changes while the page is open
- **THEN** the affected row SHALL update without a manual refresh

### Requirement: Task creation form
The management page SHALL offer a creation form with: schedule entry (preset frequencies — e.g. daily at a time, weekly at a day and time — plus a custom cron expression), an agent picker populated from the available presets, a prompt field, and a timezone that defaults to the client's current timezone. One-shot scheduling at an absolute date-time SHALL also be available.

#### Scenario: Create a daily task
- **WHEN** the user picks "daily at 09:00", selects an agent, and enters a prompt
- **THEN** a recurring job is created with the client's timezone attached
- **AND** the job appears in the list with its next run time

#### Scenario: Custom cron expression
- **WHEN** the user enters a custom cron expression
- **THEN** invalid expressions SHALL be rejected with a visible error before submission

### Requirement: Job actions
Each job entry SHALL offer pause, resume, delete, and run-now actions with immediate feedback, reflecting optimistic state that reconciles with the broadcast job status.

#### Scenario: Pause from the list
- **WHEN** the user pauses an enabled job
- **THEN** the entry shows paused state
- **AND** the server-side job stops firing

#### Scenario: Delete confirmation
- **WHEN** the user deletes a job
- **THEN** the system asks for confirmation before removal

### Requirement: Task output is reachable from the list
Each job entry SHALL link to the job's dedicated session, so the user can read the output a scheduled task has produced.

#### Scenario: Open a task's output
- **WHEN** the user taps a job's output link
- **THEN** the app opens that job's session in the chat view

### Requirement: Schedule display is human-readable
The list and creation form SHALL render schedules in the active locale as human-readable text (e.g. "每天 09:00") alongside the raw cron expression when a custom expression is used, with the timezone shown explicitly.

#### Scenario: Localized schedule text
- **WHEN** the list renders a daily job while the locale is zh-CN
- **THEN** the schedule reads as a localized daily-time phrase and the timezone is visible

### Requirement: Unread indication on task output sessions
Session-list entries and task-list entries for a job whose session has new output the user has not yet viewed SHALL carry a visible unread indication. Rendering the badge is this capability's concern; what counts as unread is defined by `scheduled-task-notifications`.

#### Scenario: Badge after scheduled run
- **WHEN** a job fires and produces output while its session is not open
- **THEN** the session list shows an unread indication on that job's session
- **AND** the indication clears when the user opens the session
